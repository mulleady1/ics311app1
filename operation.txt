To use Battle of the Dynamic Sets, you need to first compile and run the project according 
to the first method in README.txt.  Upon running the project, you are given a menu that 
looks like this:

    Available commands: runtest insert search delete pred succ min max size p
    Press q <Enter> to quit.
    Enter a command: 

The purpose of this menu, as well as the application, is to perform operations on the
different implementations of the DynamicSet interface.  You can perform operations
individually by using all but the first 'Available commands'.  For example, you can INSERT
a key into the sets, and then SEARCH for said key.  You can insert multiple keys, then run
predecessor (PRED), successor (SUCC), minimum (MIN), maximimum (MAX), SIZE, and print (P)
operations.  To run all operations and view their running times, do a RUNTEST.
